ImageRescaler
======================

This is a quick and dirty first version of a [Bolt CMS](https://github.com/bolt/bolt) extension. It's not tested or anything so use at your own risk.

Bolt CMS has powerful image scaling. However, when directly inserting images in WYSIWG content fields, these images don't get scaled even if they are way larger than they need to be.

This plugin introduces the `limitImageWidth` Twig Filter. Use it on any html object:

````
{{ page.content|limitImageWidth(800) }}
````

It will replace the origin image with a smaller one generated by Bolt's thumb function.
